10002,Will SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son's promises move the FTC?,http://www.techtimes.com/articles/4312/20140312/softbank-ceo-masayoshi-sons-promises-fail-to-move-ftc.htm,Tech Times,t,dtBNhkt0YyqHCuM_AG4A9VctDEl7M,www.techtimes.com,1394714708968,"Merge Sprint and T-Mobile and the tandem will give the goliaths of U.S. telecommunications a good fight that will benefit customers. That sums up the message of SoftBank's big boss Masayoshi Son who has presented his case before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The 42nd richest man in the world who snatched Sprint in a multi-billion dollar deal in 2013, went stateside this year to spearhead his campaign that will convince regulators in the country no to block the merger of the third and fourth biggest carriers in the U.S. Son has delivered a meaty presentation in Washington backed up by a slide show to emphasize his point.

""It's not the case that American consumers pay more because Americans use more data,"" said Son.

""We have the spectrum; we have the technology. But we need scale efficiency to make an investment in the network.We can start a small fight but it does not scale, it does not last, it's not sustainable. We need to have a real fight - a long and deep and heavy fight. And for that we need scale.""

Son believes that with the tag team of Sprint and T-Mobile, it can compete with AT&T and Verizon, which control two-thirds of the wireless market.

He also emphasized the problem of the U.S., placing 15th in a list of 16 economies in terms of broadband speed but having the second most expensive offerings for consumers. The country has an average LTE speed of 6.5Mbps, just edging the Philippines where 5.3Mbps is the current average.

""Japan had the most expensive Internet before I started. As a result of our challenge, Japan became (the country with) the highest speed Internet and the lowest price,"" the SoftBank CEO said.

The one hour 46-slide presentation of Son also touched on broadband access based on income of families or by education levels, availability of broadband connection across the country, what SoftBank has done, and what Sprint can do to help improve the situations in the U.S.

Son centered on the technology of Softbank and how it can help turn around the wireless network situation in America. The chief executive's main selling point is how, if permitted by regulators, Sprint/T-Mobile can start a price war where consumers will be on the winning end.

Softbank's accomplishments in Japan, where it is one of the biggest ISPs, are impressive. Under his leadership, the company was able to grow its customers from 16 million to 35 million as of February this year, outgrowing rivals.

The Federal Trade Commission and other regulators now need to balance if indeed the benefits listed by Son are enough to persuade them to give the green light to the Sprint-T-Mobile merger.

Sprint may be fighting a losing battle, even as its chairman, Masayoshi Son, continues his charm offensive.

The government shut that down, and according to Fierce Wireless, AT&T CFO John Stephens doesn’t think the government will change its mind with Sprint.

“It would be interesting to see if the government varies from that,” Stephens said at the Deutsche Bank Media, Internet & Telecom Conference, referring to the government’s decision in 2011. “I don’t think they will.” He went on to say that it “would be surprising today if they changed or reversed that opinion.”

Of course, Sprint is in a much different position than AT&T.

Facing an uphill battle against regulators likely to rebuff a merger between the nation’s third and fourth largest cell phone carriers, the Japanese billionaire who owns Sprint is making a full-court press.

Speaking at the United States Chamber of Commerce yesterday, Masayoshi Son insisted that the acquisition of T-Mobile by Sprint would ultimately improve America’s wireless broadband network, which he called sluggish and overpriced.

The evening prior, in an interview with Charlie Rose, Son vowed to instigate a “massive price war” among wireless providers if indeed the acquisition were to go through.

While the government might prevent a merger on antitrust grounds, Son called the existing duopoly by AT&T and Verizon a “pseudo-competition.”

AT&T and Verizon count 110 and 103 million subscribers, respectively. Languishing far behind, Sprint and T-Mobile tally about half as many customers -- 54 million and 47 million, respectively.

Son is the chairman of SoftBank, a Japanese telecommunications conglomerate that purchased a majority stake in Sprint last year for a reported $21.6 billion.

According to The New York Times, his address to the Chamber of Commerce featured patriotic slides touting the American flag, as well as numerous references to his own professional accomplishments.

As the richest man in Japan, Son reportedly noted that, before the dot-com bubble burst, “I was richer than Bill Gates for three days.”

“We can start a small fight but it does not scale,” Son said of Sprint’s relatively diminutive reach. “We need to have a real fight -- a long and deep and heavy fight. And for that we need scale.”

But scale hasn’t stopped T-Mobile from provoking some skirmishes of its own. After dubbing itself the ""un-carrier,"" the company offered in January to pay the early-termination fees of AT&T, Verizon and Sprint customers who quit their contracts to join the T-Mobile network.

This isn’t the first time that a competing carrier has made a bid to snap up T-Mobile. In 2011, AT&T was blocked from taking over the company by the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice.

At least that’s the case the folks at Sprint and Softbank are trying to make. Regulators might not be so easily convinced. AT&T tried to buy T-Mobile US for itself back in 2011 for $39 billion but was shot down by regulators. The company’s CFO John Stephens is skeptical about the merger, he “doesn’t think” that its going to go through.

Stephens believes that it would be very surprising if federal regulators change their minds about consolidation in the U.S. mobile market. “I don’t think they will,” says Stephens, speculating about the reaction of federal regulators if and when a formal bid is submitted by Sprint for T-Mobile. The entire premise of shooting down AT&T’s bid was that regulators believed four national carriers would ensure proper competition.

On the other hand, Sprint Chairman Masayoshi Son is making the rounds in Washington to gain support for the merger. His argument is that the merger would give Sprint the scalability to install new infrastructure that would vastly improve the network’s service and give it the push it needs to take on the two behemoths, AT&T and Verizon.

10013,SoftBank Has New Idea for Better US Connectivity: Improve Wireless Broadband,http://www.techzone360.com/topics/techzone/articles/2014/03/12/373047-softbank-has-new-idea-better-us-connectivity-improve.htm,Techzone360,t,dtBNhkt0YyqHCuM_AG4A9VctDEl7M,www.techzone360.com,1394714711286,"Internet connectivity in the United States is pretty far behind large portions of the planet, and people feel the impact of slow—or even no—Internet access most every day. But SoftBank Corp. President Masayoshi Son may just have a solution to the problem, and it's one that actually underscores recent moves the company's making pretty nicely: put some fresh investment in wireless broadband.

Son was recently spotted trying to drum up some support for the idea of a merger between SoftBank's Sprint and recent gainer T-Mobile, and that actually represents a nice parallel for the idea of improving the state of wireless broadband in the United States. Son acknowledges that wireless broadband in its current state is really no match for faster, landline-based alternatives like cable or DSL, but with some investment, it just might be.

Son—Sprint's chairman—notes that wireless broadband is of much poorer quality than in other countries, and those who have it pay more than the equivalent abroad. While the idea of a Sprint/T-Mobile merger was less than heartily received by regulators, Son's move to reframe the argument as a boost to wireless broadband in the United States may give it a little extra help. With Sprint and T-Mobile merged, Son notes, the combined company would then have the necessary scale to more effectively compete with top-two firms Verizon and AT&T, the operators who have most of the industry's cash flow. Under Son's plan, however, the company would use price cuts to gain market share, generating a better shot at long term profitability. This strategy was previously seen working—and working well, by all reports—for SoftBank itself in Japan.

Son's plan essentially calls for turning the current landscape from two titans and two also-rans into a three-way titan battle, which in turn should spawn what Son describes as “a more massive price war, a technology war,” thanks to the market's new state as a “three-heavyweight fight.” Given that the United States lags behind Japan and South Korea—indeed, the U.S ranks number 15 out of a 16-country list in terms of Internet services—yet shows use that's very much on the rise, with about 200 million mobile broadband users using 1.2 gigabytes (that number up from 690 megabytes last year on average). Interestingly, despite the clear lag in speed, the United States has the largest number of mobile broadband users, but some of the slowest speeds.

On a certain level, this plan makes sense. Perhaps the biggest problem the United States faces in terms of improving broadband speed is related to sheer geography. Yes, other countries have much faster Internet access but these are countries that compare closely to certain states in the United States. Japan, for example, is slightly smaller than the state of Montana, by some reports. South Korea has been compared size-wise to New Jersey. The regulatory background doesn't help—some places have just one provider if any—but the geography is certainly a hindrance. But wireless Internet access does have a help there; instead of laying cable all over the country, using a wireless signal allows for more rapid establishment of a better network. That's an improvement all around, but the technology does have to improve accordingly, a development Son likely hopes to achieve.

Son may have the right idea here, but it's an idea that will need a lot of work to be really feasible. The Sprint/T-Mobile merger might make that feasibility happen, but only time will tell just how far it goes.

Masayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive of the Japanese tech giant, touted the benefits of such competition in what was billed as a major address to the US Chamber of Commerce.

“Japan had the most expensive Internet before I started,” he told the group.

“As a result of our challenge, Japan became (the country with) the highest speed Internet and the lowest price.” Son said he hopes to shake up the US market in the same way: “I want to change the US from number 15 out of 16 countries to number one.

I would like to bring new competition.” Although Son made no reference to T-Mobile, his company has made no secret that it wants to combine number three carrier Sprint with the number four wireless group to take on larger rivals AT&T and Verizon.

Asked by reporters after his speech of his plans for T-Mobile, Son said: “We have not decided yet, but scale matters to have a real fight.”

He added that the US market is now dominated by just a small group of wireless providers and that “we need a real heavyweight fight today to have real competition…

We have spectrum, we have the technology but we need scale to have efficiency to make investments.” Son appeared to be more certain of his interest during an interview that aired late Monday on PBS television.

“We would like to make the deal happen, but there are steps and details that we have to work out,” he said.

Son said he had no plans to meet US regulators during his Washington visit but that this was just ‘the first phase’ of his efforts in the American market.

SoftBank last year sealed a deal to take a controlling stake in Sprint for more than US$20 billion.

Since then reports have been swirling about a potential deal for T-Mobile, controlled by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom.

Such a deal would likely face close regulatory scrutiny; a prior effort to sell T-Mobile to AT&T was shot down by regulators in 2011.

But Son said the tech landscape is changing, citing the planned merger of the two largest US cable broadband firms, Comcast and Time Warner Cable.

He said that with Sprint’s new ultrafast technology, wireless can become a viable alternative to fixed broadband, and could even deliver higher speeds.

But Son suggested that Sprint would need to get bigger to justify the big capital expenditures needed for ultrafast wireless.

“Wireless is not an alternative to (fixed broadband) now but I would like to give this a try,” he told his audience. We have the technology. We want to deploy it,” he said.

SoftBank announced separately the hiring of a well-connected Washington insider to lead up lobbying efforts.

A company statement said Bruce Gottlieb would become executive vice president for legal and regulatory affairs, based in Washington.

Gottlieb has been president of the National Journal, part of Atlantic Media, and was chief counsel of the Federal Communications Commission and a member of the Obama-Biden Presidential Transition Team in 2008.

Analysts point out that any deal linking the third and fourth largest wireless firms would face many hurdles.

The research firm Trefis said such a deal ‘makes sense when taking a long-term view of the wireless industry’ but seems difficult.

“Deutsche Telekom is looking to exit the US market but is wary of regulatory roadblocks, which stopped a previous takeover attempt of T-Mobile.” Douglas McIntyre at 24/7 Wall Street said it is not clear if such a merger would be good thing.

“Even on the long chance that regulators would approve such a deal, it is hard to see why the merger would be good for shareholders or customers,” McIntyre said in a blog post Tuesday.

“Putting together the two firms would be a logistics nightmare.” Such a tie-up, the analyst said, “would take years to integrate properly, if it could be. — AFP",SFTBY,"['SFTBY', 'TMUS', 'SFTBY', 'TMUS', 'TMUS', 'AMD', 'VZ', 'SFTBY', 'TMUS', 'TMUS', 'AMD', 'CMCSA', 'SFTBY', 'TMUS']"

A merger between major US carriers has been attempted before to no success, but the two carriers in question now are less “major”. The FCC is notoriously resistant to having three carriers, but is keeping an “open mind” this time. As for AT&T, they don’t think a Sprint merger with T-Mobile is even possible.

AT&T CMO John Stephens said he doesn’t “think” a merger will happen. When asked if he thought the FCC would allow the merger, Stephens said “it would be surprising”, adding “I don’t think they will”. AT&T has played the T-Mobile merger game before and failed, having lost $1 billion in spectrum and a cool $3 billion fee to T-Mobile for the failed transaction.

Stephens’ comment strike us as doubt cast from their own failure to snap up T-Mobile, but he could just have insight. AT&T has a much better idea as to why their merger failed than anyone else, and discussions with the FCC may have left them feeling as if no merger between major carriers would ever be allowed. Again, the scope of a T-Mobile merger with AT&T would have been massive, while one with Sprint still keeps the new company in last place when it comes to total customers.

For their part, Sofbank (parent company of Sprint) is touting the benefits of a merger. CEO Masayoshi Son is promising a war on all fronts — including pricing and technology — should the merger happen. He wants to disrupt both AT&T and Verizon by offering customers value. A new company would also have the scale to do that, whereas separately neither Sprint nor T-Mobile do. Good for us, bad for the status quo.
