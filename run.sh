Market Rally Exhausted After Big Tech Earnings
The stimulus-driven equity markets may be exhausted after big tech released its March quarter earnings this week. The market had rallied over 30% from its lows in late March to the end of April. Now investors are pulling profits off the table with uncertainty still exceptionally high.
Big Tech Turnout 
Tech earnings were mixed. Google and Facebook both surged off the engagement tailwind that each demonstrated in their reports, boosted by the global stay at home initiative. Apple shares are seeing modest gains this morning after beating both top and bottom-line estimates, with services driving a progressively more substantial portion of its income.
Microsoft’s essential enterprise cloud services have allowed the company’s operations to get by virtually unscathed by the pandemic. The firm illustrated robust double-digit top and bottom line expansions year-over-year in its March quarter results. MSFT remains up over 10% for the year, and I suspect these shares will reach a new all-time high in the next 6-months.
Amazon shares had been trading at all-time highs going into earnings last night, and the miss on EPS estimates was enough for investors to start pulling profits. AMZN is still up 22% in 2020 thus far. This pandemic is the perfect storm for Amazon, conditioning the world to rely on its first-class e-commerce platform for their shopping needs, and further illuminating the necessity of its cloud computing services. AMZN is still too expensive for me to consider purchasing, but the long-term investment outlook is compelling.
Profit pulling from these big tech names is not the only reason that the markets have broken down the last couple of trading days. We are living in a digital world where technology drives more than just consumption patterns. Computers are now literally running the equity markets."
